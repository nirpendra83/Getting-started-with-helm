## [Project Link](https://github.com/nirpendra83/clean-architecture-docker-dotnet-angular.git)
## ✨ What is this?

A **production-ready full-stack starter kit** built using modern technologies and best practices:

- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with Signals, Material Design, and TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: .NET 9 API implementing Clean Architecture  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 using Dapper ORM  
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, and NGINX  

> Perfect for developers who want to focus on **business logic** instead of spending time setting up infrastructure.

## 🏗️ Why Clean Architecture?

Clean Architecture helps in creating maintainable, testable, and scalable applications by separating concerns and enforcing clear boundaries between layers.

### Benefits:
- Independent of frameworks and UI
- Emphasizes testability and loose coupling
- Simplifies onboarding and feature extension
- Ensures long-term maintainability

## 🚀 Application Demo

A **Contact Management Application** with:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Secure API endpoints
- Modular and extensible design
